## Research overview
I study how **environmental variability and extreme events** shape **benthic ecosystem processes**, with a particular focus on tidal-flat and coastal systems. My work asks how the *temporal structure* of environmental stress—such as the timing, duration, and variability of heat events—affects not only average performance, but also **response variability, predictability, and resilience** in benthic invertebrates.

To address these questions, I combine **controlled mesocosm experiments**, **behavioural and physiological measurements**, and **mechanistic and statistical modelling**. Across projects, I aim to link individual-level responses to sediment dynamics and broader ecosystem functioning under climate-driven change.

## Core research themes

### Environmental variability and marine heatwaves
Marine heatwaves are often treated as shifts in mean temperature, but organisms experience them as **temporally structured events**. My research examines how differences in heatwave timing, duration, and fluctuation patterns reshape physiological performance and behaviour, and how these effects differ from constant or ramped warming scenarios.

### Behaviour–sediment coupling
Benthic organisms actively modify their physical environment through bioturbation. I investigate how individual behaviours—such as burrowing, movement, and sediment reworking—scale up to influence sediment mixing, stability, and erosion. This work connects organismal responses to feedbacks that regulate tidal-flat morphology and ecosystem functioning.

### Variability, thresholds, and resilience
Beyond mean responses, I focus on **how biological variability emerges under environmental stress**. Using variance-based metrics and breakpoint-oriented analyses, I explore when increasing environmental variability amplifies biological variability, and when responses instead converge or stabilize. This perspective provides insight into thresholds and early-warning signals of ecological change.

## Analytical and experimental approach
Methodologically, my work integrates **mesocosm experiments**, **high-resolution behavioural assays**, and **reproducible data workflows** in R and Python. I place particular emphasis on transparent data structures, variance-aware analyses, and workflows that can be readily extended to synthesis and comparative studies.

Conceptually, I aim to move toward a more predictive understanding of benthic resilience by explicitly incorporating **temporal variability** into experimental design and analysis, rather than treating it as background noise.
