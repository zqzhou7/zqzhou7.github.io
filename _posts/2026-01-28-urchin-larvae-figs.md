*This experiment followed sea urchins from induced spawning through fertilization, larval development, metamorphosis, and juvenile formation under controlled temperature and salinity treatments. The post documents each stage of the cultivation process, highlighting both experimental techniques and organismal responses.*

## Inducing spawning

Adult sea urchins (*Heliocidaris crassispina*) were induced to spawn using **potassium chloride (KCl) injection**, a standard method for stimulating gamete release.

A sterile syringe was used to inject approximately **1–2 mL of 0.5 M KCl solution** into the coelomic cavity through the peristomial membrane.

Within minutes, individuals began releasing gametes:

- Females released clouds of orange eggs into filtered seawater  
- Males released white sperm directly into dry containers to maintain concentration

## Egg collection and washing

Eggs were gently collected using wide-bore pipettes to avoid mechanical damage.

To remove debris and excess coelomic fluid, eggs were washed **three times** with filtered seawater:

1. Eggs allowed to settle by gravity  
2. Supernatant carefully removed  
3. Fresh filtered seawater added  

This ensured high-quality eggs for fertilization.

## Fertilization

Concentrated sperm was diluted in seawater to create a working sperm solution.

A small volume of diluted sperm was added dropwise to the egg suspension while gently swirling.

Successful fertilization was confirmed by the appearance of a **fertilization membrane** around eggs within several minutes.

## Early embryonic development

Following fertilization, embryos were maintained in gently aerated culture vessels under defined:

- Temperature treatments  
- Salinity treatments  

Cleavage occurred rapidly, progressing from two-cell stages to blastula and gastrula forms.

## Two-arm larval stage

After several days, larvae developed characteristic skeletal arms, marking the planktonic feeding stage.

## Four-arm larval stage

With continued growth and feeding, larvae extended additional arms and increased in size.

## Metamorphosis

Competent larvae eventually settled onto suitable surfaces and initiated metamorphosis.

This process involved:

- Loss of larval arms  
- Formation of radial symmetry  
- Development of juvenile structures

## Juvenile sea urchins

Following metamorphosis, individuals developed into benthic juveniles with visible spines and test structure.

## Experimental significance

Tracking individuals from fertilization through juvenile stages allows assessment of:

- Developmental sensitivity to temperature elevation  
- Impacts of salinity stress on growth and survival  
- Carry-over effects across life stages  

These early-life responses play a crucial role in shaping population resilience under increasing climate extremes.

---

## Final reflections

Culturing sea urchins across complete developmental cycles provides direct insight into how environmental stress influences:

- Developmental timing  
- Morphological integrity  
- Settlement success  

The images presented here reflect both the technical process and the biological consequences of climate-driven stressors.
